## Introduction

Some applications require that each client organization have their application data isolated from other client organizations. This requires that one application instance, in this case your Laravel application, can connect and respond to multiple database connections and servers for any given request. This can be accomplished by creating a new connection entry for each client in your `app/config/database.php` configuration file, but this can become unmaintainable quite quickly, especially if your service is quite popular and you are adding new connections all the time. A better solution would be a hands-off, dynamic system where you could assign users to tenants, or remove them at any given time.

The Stillat Tenant service makes getting a setup like this running quickly. Using the Tenant service, you can define what migrations will run on your clients tenants (databases). It also provides Artisan commands to create or remove client tenants, run migrations or roll them back. In addition to the Artisan commands, it also exposes a simple API to make using it simple.

## Configuration

Stillat makes connecting a single application instance to multiple databases at a time very easy. This can be useful when developing Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. The tenant configuration file should be `app/config/tenant.php`. If this file does not exist (likely if you have just installed the Stillat framework), you should create it.

The default configuration file should look like this:

    <?php

    return array(

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Default Tenant Table Names
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | This option controls the names of the tables that the tenant manager will
        | create when you run commands such as tenant:install, amongst other things.
        |
        */
        'tableNames' => array(

            'tenantTable' => 'tenants',

            'accountsTable' => 'tenant_accounts',
        ),

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Schema Prefix
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | An optional two character schema prefix to be used when creating or
        | dropping schemas. This should remain consistent.
        |
        */
        'schemaPrefix' => '',

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Preserve Connection Read/Write Values
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | This option indicates whether or not the tenant service will attempt to
        | preserve the default connections read and write database options.
        |
        | A sensible default has been set.
        |
        */
        'preserveReadWrite' => false,

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Migration Behavior
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | This option controls the migration behavior when running migrations on
        | multiple tenants. The mode 'except' will run all the migrations that
        | have been defined except what is listed here. The mode 'only' will only
        | run the migrations that have been listed here.
        |
        | A sensible default has been set.
        |
        */
        'migrationBehavior' => 'except',

        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Migrations
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | A list of migrations that the tenant service will use when running
        | migrations on tenant servers. Refer to the "Migrations Behavior" setting
        | to see what can be done with this before adding new migrations here.
        |
        | Note: You do not have to specify any migrations if you do not want to.
        */
        'migrations' => array(
            'CreateUsersTable'
        ),

    );
