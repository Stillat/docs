Stillat Documentation
===

This documentation repository contains the documentation for all Stillat components.

## Contributing
===

If you want to contribute to the documentation for a **stable release**, submit it to the corresponding branch. For example, documentation for Stillat 1.0 would be submitted to the `1.0` branch. Documentation intended for future releases should be submitted to the `master` branch.

## Task Management
===

For now (at least) we will be using the `Issues` feature as a task management system, as this is a quick way for us to post tasks and collaborate on tasks, as well as issues. New tasks should have the label "Task". Tasks that cannot be completed at the moment should have the label "On Hold". If you want to encourage feedback and discussion on a task, add the label "Needing Feedback".
